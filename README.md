# Heart-Desease-Prediction
Research about Heart desease prediction using the Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

The critical importance of early diagnosis in cardiovascular diseases, which remain the leading cause of death worldwide, is underscored by their prevalence and the potential for misdiagnosis. 

In this research, we aim to replicate and extend the work of "Classification models combined with Boruta feature selection for heart disease prediction" by G. Manikandan et al. (2024). Our study will apply the Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and XGBoost algorithms with Boruta feature selection on the Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

Contrary to the findings reported in article, no superior results were observed when Boruta feature selection was employed in this investigation. Among all classification methods examined, Logistic Regression without the application of Boruta feature selection emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 89%.
